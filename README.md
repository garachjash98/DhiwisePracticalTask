Objective:
Develop an Android application in Kotlin that accurately identifies and generates JSON hierarchies for login and sign-up screens. The app should meticulously categorize design elements like EditText, Button, Text, and Image based on the provided guidelines. It should also incorporate asynchronous data fetching and storage of screen data in a device’s file system.

Core Features to Implement:
1. Android application:
- Create an Android application in Kotlin for inputting Figma file links, and Figma token.
- Implement a user-friendly UI that allows for easy input and interaction.
2. Asynchronous Data Fetching:
- Implement asynchronous fetching of screen data from the provided endpoint.
- Store the fetched data in a device’s file system.
3. Element Identification:
- Read the data from the device’s file system and  Implement functionality to identify and categorize design elements, including EditText, Button, Text, and Image.
- Precisely recognize and classify each element type based on its attributes and characteristics.
4. JSON Hierarchy Generation:
- Generate JSON structures representing the hierarchy of design elements for the login and Sign-up screens.
- Include properties such as background, text style, color, left or right icons, height, width, etc., in the JSON hierarchy.

Device’s file system Integration:
- Use the device’s file system to store and manage the design elements and their attributes.
- Implement file operations to read and write files (With Permission) that contain the hierarchy of design elements for the login and sign-up screens.
- Ensure that the file structure is well-organized and each file represents a coherent set of screen data, allowing for efficient data retrieval and updates.
- Implement file-handling mechanisms to ensure data integrity and handle exceptions gracefully during file operations.
